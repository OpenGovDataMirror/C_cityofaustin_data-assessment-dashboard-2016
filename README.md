# Open Data Progress Report

## Overview

[Open Austin](https://open-austin.org) believes 21st century governance can work for the people :muscle:. We build open source technology and organize volunteers to envision government services made simple, effective, and accessible.

Information is a service of our government. Data is a service of our government. [(See FOIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) 

Accessible data promotes better decisions and planning... And its fun to geek out on :eyeglasses:.

Austin's City Manager kicked off an "Open Data Initiative 2.0" in April 2015 ([see the Memo](http://www.open-austin.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20150408_Open_Data_Initiative_2_0.pdf)). Every city department was asked to:

1. designate an open data liaison
2. conduct a data inventory
3. submit an open data participation plan
4. publish at least three new datasets to the Cityâ€™s open data portal.  

The initial 90-day sprint has concluded and published are the results.
